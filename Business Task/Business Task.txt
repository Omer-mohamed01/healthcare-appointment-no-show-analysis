The business task for this project is for the healthcare provider to analyze patient appointment data to identify the concentration of no-show behavior and revenue leakage. This analysis aims to uncover patterns across:

Clinic locations: Pinpointing which specific sites are most affected by service disruptions.


Patient demographics: Understanding which groups contribute most to missed appointments.

Scheduling logistics: Examining how factors like lead time and reminder systems impact attendance.

Ultimately, the goal is to answer key business questions that help the provider reduce no-show rates, improve scheduling efficiency, and enhance the overall patient experience
